1. Build a Twitter crawler or modify the already built crawler 
   - This will need a well-researched set of words that are most likely related to depression (find an existing dataset that is labelled and uses twitter data). 
   - Make sure you have at least a million data points 

2. Label the data since some of tweets are not related to suicide 
   - This is a very hectic process  
   - May be use other research’s data (will I use this to train my model? Will I need to collect my own data in this case?) 
   - How big of a dataset would I need for training, validation, and testing? 

3. Data cleaning and preprocessing 
   - Deal with HTML text and other characters 
   - Convert all to lower case 
   - Any more steps for preprocessing? 

4. What models should I plan to use? May be do many of them and compare accuracy and applicability?  
   - Naïve Bayse 
   - Work my way up to neural networks (can use an already built CNN) 

 

 

Train a model for data that's available 

Paper published in the Nature journal 

Classify whether a text is self-harm or not 

How companies' like FB and twitter solve that problem (self-harm) 

Make cool: train a model on available data, and scrape your own data and try to predict them...
