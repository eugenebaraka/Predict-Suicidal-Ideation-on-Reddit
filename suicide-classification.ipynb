As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.\",\n",

WHAT A BITCH I KNOW, I mean seriously what cruel joke is being played on me. I despise my life and just want to know what it would be like if i ended it and I can\\'t even do that. It\\'s so fucked too because whenever I was around \"friends\" I would just put on this macho toughness guy like nothing hurt me and I just kept everything bottled up, and there shouldn\\'t be anything in my life that I should complain about because I had the option to make it better but what good would come of it.
