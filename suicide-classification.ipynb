As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.\",\n",

Not even like telling them (my family) would help, they\\'d just consider me psychotic and they are probably right for all I know.  I\\'m 18 and have no sense on what the fuck the universe wants from me, and thinking about it, seems like the universe fucked up when they made me ( I know that\\'s not how I\\'m \"made\" just fuck off) because I don\\'t think it knows what it wants from me, and all I get from people trying to help is how they went through \"rough patches\" and just got to tough it out. I\\'m done \"toughing\" it out, life shouldn\\'t be toughing it out. I look around in my family and since I\\'m the youngest I\\'ve seen all the ridiculous shit that has happened to them all and it\\'s fucked, And I post this in this area because this isn\\'t the first time I have felt like this, I have tried to take my life before, and couldn\\'t do it. WHAT A BITCH I KNOW, I mean seriously what cruel joke is being played on me. I despise my life and just want to know what it would be like if i ended it and I can\\'t even do that. It\\'s so fucked too because whenever I was around \"friends\" I would just put on this macho toughness guy like nothing hurt me and I just kept everything bottled up, and there shouldn\\'t be anything in my life that I should complain about because I had the option to make it better but what good would come of it. I failed out of college because of this and I will probably never get back of track, so that light so-called light at the end of the tunnel is getting smaller by the day. ',\n",
